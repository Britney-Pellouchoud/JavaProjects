1a. Results for InsertRandomSpeedTest for N = 1000000:
1.43 seconds

1b. Results for InsertRandomSpeedTest for N = 2000000:
4.01 seconds

1c. Does your ECHashStringSet look roughly linear or roughly quadratic
in its scaling behavior for random strings?
probably linear, does not increase at an increasing rate.



2a. Results for InsertInOrderSpeedTest for N = 10000:
.78 seconds


2b. Results for InsertInOrderSpeedTest for N = 20000:
1.98 seconds


2c. Does your **BST**StringSet look roughly linear or roughly
quadratic in its scaling behavior for in order strings?
Quadratic, since it increases at an increasing order


Before submitting, make sure that your ECHashStringSet is capable of
handling inputs of size 1000000 in a reasonable amount of time (a few
seconds).
